# Week 14 Activity Log
## Experience Builder Final Edits
* Note: Few screenshots for this log (synthesizing what was learned from previous weeks, see previous logs for detailed breakdown on adding fieleds, or widgets etc)
* Edited the Experienece builder to have an improved appearance (not the Beaumont one)
* Improved the canopy cover calculation (but the fake canopy values definetely impede the calculation)
* Other than working on our groups final website, the rest of the time this week was spent adding the calculation for the transparent vector layer, and taking the web maps back into ArcGIS Pro to summarize the total sum of the canopy area, and the mean canopy area per Neighborhood/ Park. 
* During the final edits, a button was added in place of the link to the story map
